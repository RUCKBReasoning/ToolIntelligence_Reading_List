Must-read papers about **Tool Intelligence**.

The ability to create and utilize tools is a manifestation of human intelligence. Humanity once used stones to drive away natural predators and employed fire to retain light and warmth through the night for survival. Later on, humans used airplanes, submarines, and spaceships to navigate the skies, the seas, and expand their knowledge. 

The same principle applies to artificial intelligence entities like large language models (LLMs). In recent years, numerous studies have explored how to enable LLMs to recognize, utilize, and even create external tools to enhance their capability to complete real-life tasks assigned by humans. We name this direction **Tool Intelligence**, which serves as a key component of **LLM Agents**. We also believe that **Tool Intelligence** is a convenient solution for LLM 2B applications.

There are some [similar previous collections](https://github.com/thunlp/ToolLearningPapers) summarizing some of these works, but not in the same view and not being updated.

So we create this repo with a list of resources related to **Tool Intelligence**, aiming to help the related researchers have a better view of existing works, thus facilitating the development of this area.
